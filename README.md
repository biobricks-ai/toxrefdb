# ToxRefDB

ToxRefDB contains mammal toxicity information that when combined with other sources of information, such as exposure and metabolism, form the basis for chemical risk assessments.

This brick takes mysql data from the ToxRefDB Clowder archive and creates a sqlite database.

Documentation for the schema is available on the archive.
